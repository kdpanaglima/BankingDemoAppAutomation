<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This repository is just an example of a test automation framework built on top of Selenium WebDriver with Java.
This framework follows the Page Object Model design pattern with Page Factories. Apache Maven was used
as the primary project management tool to handle the build process and dependencies. 

Web App being automated in this repository is a demo site called ParaBank, a banking app that simulates a real online banking website. 


<!-- JENKINS INTEGRATION -->
## Jenkins Integration

This repository is also integrated with Jenkins. Reach out to me to get access with it. 
As of now, Jenkins executes the test cases every 30 minutes. It can also be configured to send test reports as email every time a test failue is encountered during the scheduled test executions.

ExtentReports library is integrated with Jenkins, test reports for the last executed build can be displayed within Jenkins.
