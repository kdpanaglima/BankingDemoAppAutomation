## About The Project

This repository is just an example of a test automation framework built on top of Selenium WebDriver with Java.
This framework follows the Page Object Model design pattern with Page Factories. Apache Maven was used
as the primary project management tool to handle the build process and dependencies. 

Web App being automated in this repository is a demo site called ParaBank, a banking app that simulates a real online banking website.
